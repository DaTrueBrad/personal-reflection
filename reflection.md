## How has your knowledge of the tech field changed since class began?
I had no idea that the tech field was as large and structured as it is. It was nice to see all facets of the industry, and experience a little bit of everything form the front end all the way to the back end.

## What was the most difficult part of Foundations for you? And how did you overcome that?

It's hard for me to say this was difficult, or what was most difficult. THis actually was my best learning experience, ever! It was so fast-paced that it forced me to keep up, whereas most other learning experiences are somewhat slow paced and I sometimes get complacent and lazy.

## Did you learn anything about the way you learn? What was it?

I learned that I work best in a fast-paced environment! I thought I learned best in a typical college-esque class environment, but this was fantastic! I loved doing a lecture followed by direct application the same day, it was a lot, but was the best!


## How will you apply what you know about your learning style during Specializations?

I will keep everything fast-paced, and immediately attempt to impliment it! I think those two things together are what made this so amazing for me.

## What was your experience with pair programming like?

Pair-programming was great, but I'll be honest, for some of the labs I wish we had some time alone to try and work the problems out, and then meet back up after like an hour or so to then pair-program. That would solidify some of the concepts and allow us to think on our own for a bit, then come together and hash out some of out shortcomings.

## What parts of Foundations did you enjoy the most? (This could be anything from a specific lab or lecture to the general setup of class or a funny moment.)

Honestly, all of it! Everything from the lectures, to the slides, squads, and the assessments! I have never felt like I belonged in a learningg environment more than I did here at Dev Mountain!
